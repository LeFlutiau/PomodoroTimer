A C# application for working with the Pomodoro technique, http://www.pomodorotechnique.com.

Freely inspired from Pomodairo with which I worked for years (https://github.com/leonardoamx/pomodairo/).

Includes:

* basic timer, short and long pauses
* configurable pomodoro and pauses duration
* task list

This is a work in progress - it works for me, so i'm happy.
If you find it usefull, feel free to use it.
If you find a bug, create an issue.


Cheers!
